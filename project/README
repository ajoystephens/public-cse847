This is the code to accompany the CSE847  end of semester class project.

To run the code:
1. Check/Install requirements.txt
3. Run desired bash script: adult.sh compas.sh german.sh
2. You might get an error msg from aif360 prompting for extra data setup, follow the instructions

If you want to see the exact results from my run-through that was documented in the project you can check the associated file.
 - result_adult.txt
 - result_compas.txt
 - result_german.txt

If you want to send output to text file (such as result_adult.txt):
$ ./adult.sh >> result_adult.txt



warnings: 
 - the spikes folder is an absolute mess. It's where I play around with ideas before implementing the final version of things. You can look, but it really is a mess.
 - requirements.txt does not consider requirements associated with the spikes folder
